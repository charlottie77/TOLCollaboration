           No, a current is just the rate of flow of charge through a point which is a concept, 
           not a material that can be used to make something. In reality, a battery is made up of 
           <span>chemical compounds</span>.

            Not quite right, metal is just one of the many components that are present in the battery, 
            in reality it is made up of <span>chemical compounds</span>.

         <p>
            Not really. Are you sure you are thinking of a phone battery? The phone cannot run using 
            cotton and is made up of <span>chemical compounds</span>
